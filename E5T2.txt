# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
Depend on requirements of project and the language I use, I will choose different tools.
If the I use cloudformation
- cfn-lint, cloudSploit ...
if I use terraform (there are others languages but for now I just assume we are using terraform)
- Chef inspec, regula, terrascan ...

Because I need to choose one to give an example of a violation: I choose Regula

### Example vulnerability
- when we define terraform code, if we declare an over permissive IAM policy, such as "s3:*". It will violate rule 
this https://docs.fugue.co/FG_R00218.html

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
Same above there are many tools, depends on usages and requirements we can choose a suitable tool.
If we need dynamic scanning, we can use
- aquasec, twistlock ..
If we only need static scanning, we can use
- AWS inspector, clair ...

I choose AWS inspector for this question

### Example vulnerability
- If we allow SSH password login, It will violate the rule check

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
I choose AWS config
### Example vulnerability
For example, we have a rule to enforce default encryption to be enabled for S3. If any buckets don't enable default-encryption, It will violate the rules
