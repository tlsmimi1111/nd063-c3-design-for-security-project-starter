# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Only include realiable IP addresses in the ingress rule of SSH, or don't allow SSH connection
- Disable SSH password authentication
- Enable WAF rate-based rules to detect abnormal behaviors
- Based on findings of AWS guard, trigger Cloud Watch event to block SSH from attacker IPs
# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
We can assign specific IAM role to users who need access to the S3 bucket. We enforce server-side encryption with a customer-managed Key (SSE-KMS), and only the mentioned IAM role has right to use the key to decrypt data
By doing this, even IAM credentials of Application instances are exploited, attackers cannot access data in S3.
