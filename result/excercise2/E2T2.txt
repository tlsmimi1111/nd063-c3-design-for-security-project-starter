From Inspector
These are most common issues
1. Web instances are reachable from a wide range of ports and protocol (ex:port 23 UDP/TCP associated with telnet,port 20,21 TCP/UDP associated with FTPS )
Severity : High, Medium
Recommendation: 
Remove over permissive rules
- allow connect from everwhere with all Protocols and ports
- allow SSH from everywhere

From AWS config
1. S3 buckets are not enabled with server-side encryption
Recommendation: Enable server-side encryption on bucket level, and enfore server-side encryption when putting objects in buckets via bucket policies
2. Assign over permissive IAM policy for Web instance
Detailed: Allow web instance to perform all actions with S3
3. EC2 instances don't use VPC endpoint to connect to S3
Recommendation: Apply VPC endpoint so that traffic resides in VPC, not go to public internet
