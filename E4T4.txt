# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- we can modify the security group of the webinstance. In detail, 
    - modify SSH connection rule to only allow acccess from trusted resources, or totally remove SSH related rule.
    - remove the super over permissive rule to accept all connections from all protocols, from all protocols
    - only allow HTTP/HTTPS connections from the ALB, by defining source of these rules as the Security group of the ALB
- we can put the web application instance to a private network, add Gateway endpoints so that this instance can talk to S3 privately
- we can implement Cloudwatch alarms based on custom metrics related to internet security to get alerted


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- I beleive it don't solve the problem. Because VPC endpoint only allow traffics to S3 remain in private network, it doesn't do anything related to authorization.
If the attack instance manages to SSH into the web instance, It will still be able to get secret in the seceret bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- No, It only encrypts objects that are put in the bucket after the default encryption is enabled

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- In this case, the cloudformation template will be marked as drifted. It means that resources have been changed in comparision with what are defined in the template
